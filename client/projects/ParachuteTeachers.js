  background: 'In early 2016, I contributed to the development of a platform for an early-stage education startup out of Boston. What began as a way to enhance my Python skills and learn a new JavaScript framework led to a keen interest in the problem we were trying to solve. Our goal was to revolutionize the substitute management space, providing a modern system for school districts and knocking down the barriers that prevent community members from substitute teaching.',
